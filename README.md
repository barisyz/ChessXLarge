This game is not an ordinary chess game. Game rules:
* Chess pieces are randomly placed on 32x32 chessboard for every game. 
* Piece movement rules nearly same as the original chess.
* Each turn, player makes moves to capture other player chess pieces. A turn duration is 10 seconds and the next turn the other player will play.
* Aim of the game is capturing every chess piece of other player.
